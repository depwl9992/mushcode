# MUSHCode
A repository of my homebrew mushcode systems, primarily written for [PennMUSH](https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush)! These may be heavily modified from [MUSHCode.com](https://mushcode.com) or written from scratch. I'll try to give proper attribution where applicable!

I operate primarily out of MUSHClient, so any xml plugins uploaded will be formatted for that client.

Note - My MUSH operates with a few global attribs, namely &STATUS, which serves as a shortdesc for the contents line. Omit as you see fit.
